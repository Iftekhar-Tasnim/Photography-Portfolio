About Me
I am a documentary and street photographer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My journey began in 2015 when I joined my college photography club, later continuing with the Dhaka University Photography Society (DUPS). My involvement with the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU) further shaped my perspective, allowing me to capture the vibrant political and cultural life of the campus.
Professionally, I have worked with organizations such as Democracy International, Plan International and several NGOs and INGOs, focusing on social issues and community stories. My photographs have appeared in leading publications including The Daily Star and The Business Standard reflecting both journalistic and artistic dimensions of my work.
Currently, I am pursuing photography at Counter Foto – A Center for Visual Arts. My focus lies in documentary and street photography, where I aim to tell authentic human stories through powerful and honest frames.
