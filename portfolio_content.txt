    Album Title : The July Uprising 2024: Collective Struggle and People’s Power in Bangladesh 

    Description: The July Uprising 2024 in Bangladesh was a historic moment when thousands of ordinary people came together to demand justice, dignity and change. What began with students quickly grew into a nationwide movement that drew in workers, teachers, rickshaw pullers  and communities from every corner of the country. It was a time when strangers stood side by side, proving that collective strength is more powerful than fear.
    These photographs document the uprising not just as political unrest, but as a human story of resilience, grief, and solidarity. In the crowded streets of Dhaka and beyond, voices united in chants for freedom and accountability. Faces of exhaustion, determination and quiet defiance told a story no speech could capture the story of a people who refused to be silenced.
    The July Uprising 2024 will be remembered as more than a political movement. It was a collective cry for justice and a testament to the enduring belief in people power. Even in the most difficult moments, the uprising proved that when citizens rise together with courage and unity, they can reshape history.


    Album Title : Narir Dake Maitree Jatra 2025: Women’s March for Equality and Justice in Bangladesh

    Description: The Narir Dake Maitree Jatra 2024 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was a landmark women-led march demanding equal rights, dignity, and social justice. Held in front of the National Parliament at Manik Mia Avenue, the procession united women workers, students, teachers, cultural activists, professionals, and supporters from diverse communities under the central slogan: “We are for equality.”
    Participants marched with colourful banners and placards, calling for 33% political representation for women, urgent legal reforms, protection of marginalised groups, and recognition of invisible labour. The declaration strongly condemned gender-based violence, government inaction, wage disparity, and systemic exclusion of women and minorities.
    The procession also extended solidarity to sex workers, LGBTQ+ communities, migrant workers, and indigenous women of the Chattogram Hill Tracts. Slogans rang out against patriarchy, fascism, and inequality, while cultural groups and student organisations amplified the collective demands for justice.
    As organisers noted, the Maitree Jatra was not an isolated event but part of Bangladesh’s long continuum of struggles — from the 1971 Liberation War to anti-rape protests, labour movements, and indigenous rights activism. The march reaffirmed the power of collective action, declaring that the rights of women and marginalised groups are non-negotiable.
    Through these photographs, the march is documented as both a political statement and a human story of courage, solidarity, and the refusal to remain silent in the face of injustice.

1. World Press Photo Exhibition 2024 in Dhaka: Global Stories Through the Lens
The World Press Photo Exhibition 2024 at Drik Gallery, Dhaka, brought together some of the most powerful visual stories from around the globe. Curated from the prestigious World Press Photo Contest, the exhibition highlighted humanity’s pressing issues climate change, conflict, migration and resilience. Each frame reflected the universal power of photojournalism to document truth and inspire change.
Covering the event for The Daily Star, I explored how this exhibition connected global struggles with local realities. Voices from distinguished guests such as Shahidul Alam, Irma van Dueren, and Irene Khan framed the exhibition as not only an artistic endeavor but also a statement on press freedom and democracy.
From raw portrayals of war to intimate stories of displacement, the images reminded viewers that photography transcends borders, becoming both testimony and protest. In Dhaka’s context, where the fight for free expression remains deeply rooted in history, the exhibition carried a powerful message: photography is not just about seeing, but about understanding.
